This is an app I built using node express that will take in questions from an input form and check them against other users in the database to see if there is anyone who answered similarly.

You can test the app on https://polar-meadow-13160.herokuapp.com/ 

On the Navbar I included a link to view the API for this site, so you can see all users who have entered and saved their information into the database. 

Enjoy
